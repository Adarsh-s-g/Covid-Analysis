# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the COVID-19 data obtained from WHO, using SQL for data cleaning and exploration. The data was then visualized in Python to understand key trends.

### Data Sources
- The data was obtained from WHO.

### Steps in the Project
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Handled missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers using SQL.
   - The cleaned dataset is saved as SQL tables for further exploration.

2. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Performed analysis on COVID-19 trends (e.g., case rates, recovery rates, etc.) using SQL queries.
   - Key results were stored in SQL tables.

3. **Visualization**: 
   - Visualized the results using Python with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

### SQL Queries
- **Data Cleaning**: 
- **Data Exploration**: 

### Visualizations
The data was visualized in Python. Key visualizations include:
- Case rates over time
- Comparison between affected regions
- Recovery and death rates
